# Excel-Kickstarter-Analysis

## First Excel Project

### Challenge 1

This repository consists of an analysis of various fundraising kickstarter camaigns and their performance against their goals. The analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of the size of Goals and also the impact of the Launch date on the success rate of meeting the Goal

Outcomes Based on Launch Date: This chart shows the impact of launch month on the outcomes. On the X-axis is the month the campaign was launched and the Y-axis has the number of campiagns. Each colored line in the chart represents the outcome of a campaign i.e. successful, failed or canceled.
We observe that May and June see a spike in the number of campaigns launched and also the success rate.
Lowest number of campaigns and success rate is seen in the months of Dec and Jan. The holiday season may be the driver behind this.

Outcomes Based on Goals: This chart shows the impact of Goal size on the outcomes. On the X-axis is the size of the Goal and the Y-axis has the number of campiagns. Each colored line in the chart represents the outcome of a campaign i.e. successful, failed or canceled.
We observe that Goal size significantly impacts the success rate of a campaign. The bigger the Goal the lesser chance of meeting it.
